# Android-carpooling

Over the past decade, problems related to traffic congestion have severely aggravated in city centres
across the globe. Today increase of environmental concerns and the congestion of roads, carpooling
has gained a lot of popularity when it comes to environment friendly and cheap ways of travelling.
Carpooling reduces pollution since we have less cars on the road. It’s also economic since the travel
expenses are shared among the riders. Travelling alone may be stressful, so having other persons with
you on a trip reduces the stress and is also the occasion to socialize and make the trip funnier. As said,
the expenses, both environmental and fiscal, of single occupancy vehicles could be reduced by
utilizing the empty seats in personal transportation vehicles. Carpooling and ride sharing target those
empty seats: taking additional vehicles off the road reducing traffic and pollution, whilst providing
opportunities for social interaction. However, historically carpool scheduling often limited users to
consistent schedules and fixed rider groups–carpooling to the same place at the same time with a set
person or a group of people. To make that problem worse, the leading problem concerns, given in a
2009 survey about why people don’t carpool, were difficulty to organize carpools and inconvenience
of organization. We feel both of those can be addressed by employing some novel web technologies
and modern-day available data stores which hold social and location based individual user’s data.
Besides having to solve the aforementioned problems for making a carpooling and ride-sharing
solution that users will want to use.
This Android carpooling system has been developed to help encourage carpooling by helping
passenger “find a ride” with other passengers or ride alone . And additionally, this application provides
a feature where we can provide a car on rent to drivers and payment for rent will be calculated on
number of days he has taken the car.
Security is always a concern with ride-sharing as carpooling with strangers could prove to be risky. To
address this issue and improve security, the admin has been given the sole authority to verify
driver/renter. Renter/driver can’t log in and access the modules unless their request has been verified
by the admin. Along with being helpful for commuting, carpooling is also a viable method of inter-city
or inter-state travel
